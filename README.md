QUESTIONS:

1. What is a website, and how is it different from a web application? 

2. Why do you think organizations(like offices or schools) need websites?

3. What challenges did you encounter while creating your first repository?

4. How might this practice of documentation (README) help in future projects?



ANSWERS:

1. In office contexts, website serve as the bulletin board or information portal that shows announcement, policies, schedules etc. It is usually a read-only where users just read and perform the task. It is more simple and minimalist unlike web applications. On the other hand, web applications serves as a book that interacts with its users like requesting or messaging.
   
2. Organizations such as offices and schools need websites because these platforms serve as a reliable source of information and communication. A website makes it easier to share announcements, schedules, and updates that can be accessed anytime and anywhere. It also helps build the organizationâ€™s visibility and credibility, making it easier for the public to know more about their services and activities. Furthermore, websites allow offices and schools to provide online services, such as enrollment, access to resources, or form submissions, which makes processes more efficient. Overall, a website is an essential tool for connecting with people and making services more accessible.
   
3. While creating my first repository, I did not encounter any challenges since I'm a bit familiar with this application. But I'm still learning the other function of GitHub.
   
4. Writing a README file is very helpful for future projects because it serves as a guide for other students who did not know how to use them. If other students will be able to learn how to use GitHub, it will make it easier for collaborations on a project for example.
